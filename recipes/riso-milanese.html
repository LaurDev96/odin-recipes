    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Risotto Milanese (with Saffron and bone marrow) is the winter dish par
      excellence. When the wolves roam in the snow outside, a steaming plate of
      yellow rice with Saffron can warm your heart and put you in a good mood.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>500 grams of Carnaroli rice</li>
      <li>2,5 liters of broth</li>
      <li>120 grams of white wine</li>
      <li>60 grams of butter</li>
      <li>80 grams of Parmigiano Reggiano cheese</li>
      <li>14 grams of bone marrow</li>
      <li>4 grams of saffron</li>
      <li>200 grams of yellow onion</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a medium saucepan, bring the chicken stock to a simmer; keep warm. In
        a large saucepan, heat the olive oil. Add the onion, season with salt
        and pepper, and cook over moderate heat, stirring, until softened, about
        5 minutes. Add the rice and cook for 1 minute, stirring to thoroughly
        coat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Crumble the saffron into the wine and add it to the rice. Cook,
        stirring, until the wine is absorbed. Add 1 cup of the warm stock and
        cook over moderate heat, stirring constantly, until nearly absorbed.
        Continue adding the stock 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly, until
        it is nearly absorbed between additions.
      </li>
      <li>
        The risotto is done when the rice is al dente and suspended in a thick,
        creamy sauce, about 20 minutes total. Season the risotto with salt and
        pepper. Stir in the cheese, butter, and parsley and serve immediately.
